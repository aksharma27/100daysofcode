# Getting Started with Create React App

# React Hooks: 
1) import hooks from react - import React, {useState} from 'react';
2)the hooks can only be called inside the react func component, and define it at the top level of the function : 

const UseState = () =>{
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
}

3) hooks cannot be conditional
